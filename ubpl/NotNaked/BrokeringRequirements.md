## **1\. Hyper Real-Time Inventory Sync**

* **Limited Edition Drops**  
   We release limited-edition, limited-inventory items. During product launches, our OMS must update inventory in real time across all channels (online, partner stores, outlet stores) to avoid overselling.  
* **Immediate Stock Updates**  
   Orders, cancellations, and returns should reflect instantly in our inventory system so staff and customers always see accurate availability.

## **2\. Order Handling and Packaging**

* **Flyers for First-Time Customers**  
   All first-time customers should receive a flyer in their shipment. The system should flag these orders automatically.  
* **Special Packaging for High-Priced Items**  
   We have a specific list of SKUs that need special boxes. The OMS should prompt packers with clear instructions to use the correct packaging.

## **3\. Partner Store Brokering**

* **20% Order Allocation**  
   We want to send 20% of online orders to our partner stores for fulfillment. The OMS should track partner store inventory and allocate orders accordingly.  
* **Prioritize Outlet Store Inventory**  
   Our outlet stores carry older or excess stock. We want these items to be the first choice for standard online orders whenever possible, unless the item must be handled by a partner store.

## **4\. SKU Management and Bundling**

* **Earring Single/Pair Conversion**  
   Some earrings can be sold individually or as a pair. When a pair is sold (a virtual SKU), the OMS needs to convert that into 2 units of the single-SKU item, reducing single-item stock properly.  
* **Bundles with ERP-Managed Components**  
   Certain products are sold as bundles (one main SKU), but the individual components are tracked in our ERP. When allocating, please ensure that bundles arenâ€™t split up. If an order is partially fulfilled from multiple locations, each bundle still needs to ship as a complete set from a single location.

## **5\. Order Splitting Logic**

* **Minimum Split Value**  
   If an order needs splitting, each split portion should have a retail value of at least $50. If the partial split falls below that threshold, the system should keep the entire order together in one fulfillment location or highlight it as an exception.
