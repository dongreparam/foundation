## create#org.apache.ofbiz.shipment.shipment.Shipment

**Sample shipment JSON representation**

### POS orders are simple case, 
* POS sales orders are created, for the order, Shipment is created in the completed status. 
* The Picking and Packaging process is not required, in such scenario, the input shipment map will not have `shipmentPackages`,`shipmentPackageContents`, `shipmentRouteSegments`, `shipmentPackageRouteSegs`
