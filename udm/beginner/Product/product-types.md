**Raw Material** is the basic material used for manufacturing of a product/good. It is in unprocessed or minimal processed state.

**Services** are the intangible products such as accounting, banking, cleaning, consultancy, education, insurance, expertise, medical treatment, or transportation. The services are rendered to us by service providers having expertise in the particular field. No transfer of possession or ownership takes place when services are sold, and they cannot be stored or transported, and they come into existence at the time they are bought and consumed.

**Good** -- A good is a tangible physical product which we sell to our customers that can be contrasted with a service which is intangible. As such, it is capable of being delivered to a purchaser and involves the transfer of ownership from seller to customer. For example, an apple is a tangible good, as opposed to a haircut, which is an (intangible) service.

**Configurable Good** â€“ When there are large number of parts which go in a product or whose combination constitute a product, then such kind of product is known as a configurable good. Ex-- Bike, Computer, Cell phone etc.

Group of features for a particular product at an instance is termed as product variant. Before you can add a product variant to a product, you must specify in the product definition that the product will include variants. This implies that a virtual product can indeed hold inventory and that a variant product does not necessarily have to have any inventory associated with it.
